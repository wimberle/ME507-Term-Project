## ME507-Term-Project
This is the GitHub repository for the ME-507 Term Project at Cal Poly, SLO in spring 2023 under instructor Charlie Refvem
By: 
Matthew Wimberley and partner David Reo

The scope of this project was to create a robot for a competition of the game Hungry Hungry Hippos, where each robot must collect their team's respective color from an arena and deliver it to their respective home. A combination of line, ultrasonic, and color sensors in tandem with a custom designed PCB will accomplish this objective.
