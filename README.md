# ME507-Term-Project
This is the GitHub repository for the ME-507 Term Project at Cal Poly, SLO in spring 2023 under instructor Charlie Refvem
By: 
Matthew Wimberley and partner David Reo

The scope of this project was to create a robot for a competition of the game Hungry Hungry Hippos, where each robot must collect their team's respective color from an arena and deliver it to their respective home. A combination of line, ultrasonic, and color sensors in tandem with a custom designed PCB will accomplish this objective. The Bill of Materials, Schematic, PCB, Memorandum, and YouTube videos are outlined below.

## Reflection

While we fell short of our ambitious goal, this term project was ultimately very rewarding as I gained a new found respect for PCB manufacturing and the foresight that goes into designing well made boards. We were still able to get individual functionality of our line sensor, ultrasonic sensor, ball retrieving mechanism, and motor control as shown below.
